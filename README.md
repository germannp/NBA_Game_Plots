# NBA Game Plots üèÄ

NBA box scores often don't tell the full story: In a clear game both teams might rest their stars
and let their bench players gain experience towards the end. In a tight game, on the other hand,
the loosing team often tries to gain additional posessions by fouling, which can lead to both, a
closer or a wider gap. To get a fuller picture, we tweet plots along some basic statistics.
